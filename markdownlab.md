# What I Hope to Learn in INFO 201

This class sounds *very* interesting and I am excited for the quarter ahead. 

Here are some things that I am **specifically** interested in:
- How to use R
- Analyzing large datasets
- Data visualization 

Although I am not an Informatics major, I think that all of these things will be useful for me as a Finance major. R is used in the industry and I would like to build a good foundation to prepare me for my career. Being able to analyze large datasets, communicating findings and insights, and visualizing data are all very important in finance as well.
